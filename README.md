# Distributed-Shared-White-Board
Shared whiteboards allow multiple users to draw simultaneously on a
canvas. There are multiple examples found on the Internet that
support a range of features such as freehand drawing with the
mouse, drawing lines and shapes such as circles and squares that
can be moved and resized, and inserting text.
